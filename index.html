      <h3><strong>About</strong></h3>
      This is only a basic prototype of an application that tries to predict the
      range that the EV can travel depending upon certain parameters. The application uses different tensorflow models
      to continuosly capture necessary data from the sensors in the EV and make predictions for SOC, SOE, and finally
      the range of the EV depending upon the current scenario/ environment of the vehicle.

      <br>
      <br>

      <strong>
        <h4>The application uses three tensorflow models</h4>

      <div class="model-info">

        <strong>&#09 1. SOC Predictor</strong><br><br>
        This model focuses on predicting the SOC (State of Charge) of the battery from the battey's
        <span class="highlight">voltage (V)</span>, <span class="highlight">current (A)</span>, and <span
          class="highlight">temperature (degree Celcius)</span>
        data. <br><br>

        For training the model, we have used the drive cycle data from the <a
          href="https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/wykht8y7tg/1" target="_blank">
          <stron><em>Panasonic 18650PF Li-ion Battery</em></stron>
        </a> dataset. Various charging and discharging cycle tests were performed on the lithium-ion battery, at
        different temperatures and rates. We are interested in the drive cycle data.The drive cycle power profile is
        calculated for an electric <span class="highlight">Ford F150 truck</span> with a 35kWh battery pack scaled for a
        single 18650PF cell. <br><br>

        For training the model for SOC estimation, we have used the drive cycle data available at 25&#8451;, taking into
        consideration, the real life temperature scenario of driving an EV. The required data was extracted out, it was
        preprocessed,
        outliers were removed, and it was normalized before using for training the tensorflow model. The neural network
        architecture used in the model is as follows:

        </div>

        <br><br>

        <strong>&#09 2. SOE Predictor</strong><br><br>
        This model builds upon the SOC model. It focuses on predicting the SOE (State of Energy) of the battery from the
        <span class="highlight">voltage (V)</span>, <span class="highlight">current (A)</span>, <span
          class="highlight">temperature (degree Celcius)</span>, and the <span class="highlight">predicted value of
          SOC</span>.<br><br>


        For training the model, we have used the same dataset as we did for SOC model. The preprocessed data along with
        the new predicted value for SOC, is used as an input to the neural network. We need the SOE for calculating the
        amount of energy (kWh) remaining in the battery for range prediction.The neural network architecture used in the
        model is as follows:

        <strong>&#09 3. Range Predictor</strong><br><br>
        This model predicts the range that the EV can travel depending upon the features like
        <span class="highlight">amount of battery energy remaining (kWh)</span>,
        <span class="highlight">type of route</span>,
        <span class="highlight">status of A/C or heater in the car</span>,
        <span class="highlight">type of tyres used</span>,
        <span class="highlight">the driving style of the driver</span>, and
        <span class="highlight">average speed of the car</span>.
        <br><br>


        For training the model, we have a used a dataset that contains real-life driving data of two Volkswagen e-Golf
        cars, with year of manufacture as 2014 and 2016 respectively. The data is available at the Spritmonitor
        website.<br><br>

        The file includes data about <span class="highlight">3615 trips</span> with a total travel distance of around

      <strong><em>Note: </em></strong> Due to the unavailability of a physical testing and data collection
      environment, the application will take in values of the required features from a predefined csv file that contains
      data for SOC & SOE estimation.
      A few features required for range prediction, needs to be provided by the user on the next page.<br><br>
